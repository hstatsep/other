# Mind Meld

## DESCRIPTION

The goal is for two people to say things together until they reach the same word. Both people think of anything at all â€“ a person, place, idea, concept, phrase: anything. When they're ready, they give a thumbs up. When both partners have their thumbs up, one/both partners say "3... 2... 1..." then they say their things.

Then they think what the common thing between those two things or associated with those two things would be.

They repeat the thumbs up / counting process and try to use the two previously stated things to arrive at a third, common one. They keep trying each time until they say the same word/phrase. Oh yeah, no repeats allowed!

When they finally arrive at the same word/phrase, they celebrate their mind-meld-iness!
